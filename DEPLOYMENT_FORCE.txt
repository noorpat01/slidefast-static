CRITICAL CSP CACHE-BUSTING DEPLOYMENT
=====================================

Timestamp: 2025-09-19 01:21:32
Issue: Browser/CDN serving cached CSP with wrong Supabase URL
Previous: connect-src contains hbekiobfacrjaeskgtru.supabase.co
Current: connect-src contains xhlpnnoskmewqkjriqxq.supabase.co (correct)
Fix: Force complete cache invalidation for CSP headers
Deploy ID: CACHE-BUST-CSP-001

This deployment forces Vercel and CDN to serve the correct CSP headers with the fixed Supabase URL.
