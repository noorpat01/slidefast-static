CRITICAL CACHE-BUSTING DEPLOYMENT
=====================================

Timestamp: 2025-09-18 01:44:00
Issue: Production serving old buggy JavaScript file index-CGvF5kFq.js
Fix: Deploying correct fixed file index-DAF3fZSv.js
Cache-Control: Disabled for all assets to force fresh load

This deployment forces Vercel to serve the correct JavaScript files with the null-safety bug fix.
